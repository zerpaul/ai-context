# AI Context Extractor

A VSCode extension that generates AI-readable context from your folders and files. This extension extracts the contents and structure of your folders or selected files into a well-formatted text file that's optimized for use with AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLMs.

## Features

- üìÑ Extract single files or multiple selected files
- üó∫Ô∏è Creates a clear hierarchy of your project's directory structure (for folder extracts)
- üìù Includes full file contents with clear separation and metadata
- üéØ Optimized output format for AI context windows
- ‚ö° Fast processing with progress indication
- üö´ Automatically skips node_modules and hidden directories when processing folders

## Usage

### Folder Extraction
1. Right-click on any folder in the VSCode explorer
2. Select "Extract AI Context" from the context menu
3. Wait for the extraction to complete
4. A new file will be created in the selected folder with the format: `foldername_timestamp.txt`

### File Extraction
1. Right-click on any single file to extract just that file
   - OR select multiple files using Ctrl+Click
2. Select "Extract AI Context" from the context menu
3. Wait for the extraction to complete
4. A new file will be created in the same directory with the format:
   - Single file: `single_file_timestamp.txt`
   - Multiple files: `selected_files_timestamp.txt`

## Output Format

The generated file includes different sections based on what you're extracting:
